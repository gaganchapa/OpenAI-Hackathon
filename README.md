# DALL-E and Whisper using Streamlit and Gradio
DALL-E 2 are deep learning models developed by OpenAI to generate digital images from natural language descriptions.

It uses a diffusion model conditioned on CLIP image embeddings, which, during inference, are generated from CLIP text embeddings by a prior model.

It can generate imagery in multiple styles, including photorealistic imagery, paintings, and emoji. It can "manipulate and rearrange" objects in its images.
